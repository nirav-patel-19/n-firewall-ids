🧠 COMPLETE PROJECT PIPELINE (HIGH-LEVEL → LOW-LEVEL)
🔵 STAGE 0 — Infrastructure & Environment (DONE ✅)

Input: Physical laptop
Output: Two communicating VMs

Ubuntu VM → Firewall / IDS / Dashboard

Kali VM → Attacker / traffic generator

Python virtual environment

Packet capture verified

✔ You have already completed this stage.

🔵 STAGE 1 — Packet Ingestion Layer (Sensor Layer)
Purpose

Collect raw network packets in real time.

Pipeline
Network Interface
      ↓
Packet Capture (Scapy)
      ↓
Raw Packet Stream

Components

Network interface (eth0)

Scapy sniff()

No filtering at this stage

Output

Packet object (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP)

Timestamped packet stream

📌 No decisions made here

🔵 STAGE 2 — Packet Parsing & Normalization
Purpose

Convert raw packets into a standard internal format.

Pipeline
Raw Packet
    ↓
Protocol Identification
    ↓
Feature Extraction

Extracted Fields
Field	Example
src_ip	192.168.222.129
dst_ip	192.168.222.130
protocol	TCP
src_port	45678
dst_port	22
flags	SYN
timestamp	epoch
Output

Normalized packet dictionary

📌 This stage feeds both Firewall & IDS

🔵 STAGE 3 — Rule-Based Firewall Engine (Policy Layer)
Purpose

Protocol-based

Direction-based (in/out)

Rule Source

JSON / YAML file

Editable dynamically

Output

Firewall decision

Firewall log entry

📌 No behavior analysis here

🔵 STAGE 4 — Signature-Based IDS (Detection Layer)
Purpose

Attack classification

📌 Runs parallel to firewall

🔵 STAGE 5 — Correlation & Decision Layer
Purpose

Combine Firewall + IDS outputs.

Pipeline
Firewall Decision
        +
IDS Alert
        ↓
Final Action

Final Actions

Allow packet

Drop packet

Raise alert

Block IP dynamically

Output

Unified security event

📌 This is the “brain” of the system.

🔵 STAGE 6 — Logging & Persistence Layer
Purpose

Maintain audit trail & evidence.

Pipeline

   ↓
API Call
   ↓
Rule Update
   ↓
Immediate Enforcement

Examples

Block attacker IP on alert

Add rule without restart

📌 This makes it enterprise-grade.

🔵 STAGE 9 — Performance & Health Monitoring
Purpose

Evaluate system efficiency.

Pipeline
System Metrics
     ↓
Resource Monitor

Metrics

CPU usage

Memory usage

Packet rate

Detection latency

📌 Important for results section.

🔵 STAGE 10 — ML-Based Anomaly Detection (Future Scope)
Purpose
